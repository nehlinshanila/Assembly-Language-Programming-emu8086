Question: take an array of size ten, display it, find the largest item and its index number, and whether or not the index is odd or even.

points:
-cant output from same reg we took input in. gotta move to different reg
-for new line, use ins after single key output instruction
-int 21h after almost every instruction
-use dw if word and db if byte in data 
-incase of word, print from dx not dl
-a string must always end with , '$'
-newline probably doesnt work in lea hence we use space
